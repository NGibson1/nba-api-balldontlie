### By Nigel Gibson

## Dependencies
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- jQuery
- React.js
- node.js
- BallDontLie API

## Quick Set-up
- git clone  https://github.com/NGibson1/nba-api-balldontlie.git
- cd nba-api-balldontlie

## Description
This was probably my favorite project I have worked on. Its a webpage where you can type in your favorite NBA players name and get back thier stat averages per game on the 2022-2023 seasons. Open source API 'BALLDONTLIE' provides all the data for each players stats. Names must be spelled correctly. With players who have more common names (ex. James), first and last name must be used. 

## Futrue plans for this project
- add a quick fill option for players names to avoid typing errors
- Add a button to the webpage that allows you to add a new player to the database.
- Add a button to the webpage that allows you to delete a player from the database.
- Use chart.js to show statistics, and compare players stats side by side
- Add NBA individual and team records
- Add team stats and standings


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
